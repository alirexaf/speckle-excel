## Documentation

#### ðŸ“š [Speckle Docs website](https://speckle.guide/dev/)

## Developing & Debugging

Register the app:

- create a Speckle App on your server
- duplicate `.env sample` to `.env.local`
- then fill it in with your variables

Run it locally:

- `npm install`
- `npm run serve`
- *You might be prompted to install some certificates, go ahead and accept*
- *Wait for the the process to start the Vue app, then in a separate terminal either*
  - `npm run excel` will run excel desktop and sideload the plugin
  - `npm run excel:web` will run excel web, open the document defined in `packages.json` and sideload the plugin

If this worked out well, you should see the connector sideloaded correctly:
